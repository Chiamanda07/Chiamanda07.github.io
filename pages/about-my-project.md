subtitle: Neural Engineering & Assistive Robotics
project_title: "Smart AI-Based Waste Bin Monitoring and Collection Optimization on Morgan State University Campus"

problem: |
  This project addresses the pressing issue of inefficient waste collection systems, which often lead to overflowing bins, sanitation challenges, and environmental degradation.

  This project seeks to explore how neural signals can be translated into reliable control commands for assistive robots, improving autonomy and quality of life.

approach: |
  The key components of this approach include:
  - Bin Fill Detection: Use YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection on images from IoT camera sensors to monitor bin fill levels in real time.
  - Forecasting Accumulation: Apply LSTM networks to time-series data to predict future waste trends and potential bin overflows.
  - Optimized Scheduling: Implement reinforcement learning (PPO or DQN) to simulate and improve waste collection routes and timing.
  - Visualization Dashboard: Develop a user-friendly dashboard to display bin statuses, overflow predictions, and optimized collection plans.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result to develop a smart, AI-powered waste bin monitoring system tailored to the Morgan State University campus.This solution will foster sustainability, reduce operational costs, and improve campus cleanliness.
  Particularly as a student in this project, at the end of the Program, I should understand and implement state-of-the-art deep learning models, analyze real-world data, and apply AI to sustainability, and contribute to a functional prototype with real-world application potential..
