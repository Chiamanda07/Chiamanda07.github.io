  bio: |
    I'm an electrical engineering student at McNeese State University. Passionate about robotics, I aspire to work at Boston Dynamics one day. I enjoy coding. I’m also exploring data analytics and constantly looking for ways to grow as a future robotics engineer.
    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy mentoring younger students, playing jazz trumpet, and tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects in my free time.
