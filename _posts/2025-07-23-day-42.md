  You’d think editing a video that’s only supposed to be 90 seconds long wouldn’t take much time—but that wasn’t the case. My biggest challenge was voice isolation. Since we didn’t have a microphone while filming, there was a lot of background noise. I was using CapCut to edit, but voice isolation is only available to Pro members. I tried searching for free alternatives online, but none really worked. So we decided to sign up for CapCut’s 7-day free trial. At first, it still wasn’t working, and I kept troubleshooting until I realized I needed to update CapCut on my laptop. After updating, we were finally able to activate the free trial, and I completed the video edit.

  After the break, I focused on the machine learning part of the methodology section in our research paper. I managed to finish it, but it will still need some review and revision.

  I'm really happy with how our video turned out! Our mentors loved it, and honestly, it might be the best one in the cohort—though I could be wrong since I haven’t seen the others yet. I’m also almost done with the methodology section; just two more subsections to go. It’s coming together really well. I’m glad we didn’t wait to start the research part after completing the whole project, but instead worked on it alongside everything else. It’s made things much smoother
