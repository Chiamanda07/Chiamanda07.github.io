what_i_learned: |
  Today, we explored the components we’ll be using in our project and learned about their functions and technical names. For example, I found out that we’ll be using the ESP32 Arduino microcontroller, Firebase to transmit data to the cloud, and an Arduino library called TinyGPS++ to obtain GPS coordinates for locating each bin.
  I also created an account on Tinkercad, where I followed YouTube tutorials to simulate electrical circuits similar to what we’ll be building physically later on. Finally, I installed the Arduino software on my computer to prepare for future hands-on work.

  One of the videos we used to build an electric circuit didn’t include any code, so we had to switch to another video that provided both the circuit design and the corresponding code.

reflection: |
   Today was a really enjoyable day, as I felt more connected to my field as an electrical engineering student. I recognized and had prior knowledge of some of the components that were mentioned, which made the experience feel more familiar and engaging.In addition to that, I gained a clearer understanding of how data is transmitted to the cloud and how it is stored using Firebase. Our faculty advisor also provided us with a lot of helpful resources to get started with Arduino, which I really appreciated.What made today stand out even more was the hands-on nature of the tasks—we did more practical work compared to last week’s focus on literature reviews. While I now better understand the importance of those reviews, it felt good to physically engage with the project today.
