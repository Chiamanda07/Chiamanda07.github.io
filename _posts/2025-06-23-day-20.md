what_i_learned: |
  Today, we worked on connecting our ultrasonic sensor to the ESP32. At first, we got confused because we were looking at different photos online, and each one used a different breadboard and components. After some time, we chose one set of instructions to follow. However, we didn’t realize we were using the wrong manual for our ESP32, which caused issues with getting any output. In the end, an environmental engineering professor helped us fix the circuit, and we were able to get it working.

  The distance in the serial monitor was not changing at first.
  We were looking for 2k ohms resistors.

  We had built a full circuit based on the instructions we found online, but it ended up looking a bit complicated. Despite all the effort, it didn’t work. When the professor came to help us, he created a much simpler version of the circuit—and it worked immediately. It showed us that sometimes simpler solutions are more effective. As he explained his setup, I noticed it was actually similar to what we had tried to do earlier. We probably just had a wire in the wrong place, but because our circuit was so complex, it was hard to spot the mistake.
