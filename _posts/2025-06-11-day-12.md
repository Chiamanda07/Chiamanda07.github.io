what_i_learned: |
  On Monday, we created a Tinkercad circuit similar to what we would be using for our project, but we didn’t have the code yet. However, using the understanding we gained from the masterclass yesterday, we were able to write the code ourselves today. The code enabled the ultrasonic sensor to emit a pulse, receive the echo, calculate the duration, convert it into distance, and display how full the bin is on the LCD screen.  
  We also enhanced Monday’s circuit by adding an LED that turns on when the bin reaches 80% capacity, signaling that it is full.  
  In addition to the hardware work, we simulated sample data and used Google Colab with libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy to perform basic data analysis and plotting. This served as a foundation for the Machine Learning concepts we’ll explore later.

  While working on the code, we encountered challenges in getting the LCD to display the output correctly.

reflection: |
   I think the masterclass was really helpful, as it allowed me to understand the flow of sample codes and adapt them to fit our specific circuit diagram. I was also able to assist teammates who were confused by breaking the concepts down into simpler terms. It was very satisfying when our code finally worked and the LCD began displaying the output.We resolved the LCD issue by interacting with certain components, such as adjusting the potentiometer to ensure it was powered on and verifying the ultrasonic sensor to properly display the bin’s fill level.
