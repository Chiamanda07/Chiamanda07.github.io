what_i_learned: |
  Today, my team and I worked on a slideshow presentation showcasing the findings from our machine learning classification model. We later presented it to our faculty mentor and received some helpful feedback.
  In addition to that, I continued working on the methodology section of our report. I was able to complete the first part and have now started writing the second.

reflection: |
  Our presentation to our mentor went really well—it sparked some insightful questions, some of which we’ll need to revisit and think through more carefully. I'm truly glad that my project group makes time to practice presenting now and then. It's been helping me grow more confident and comfortable with public speaking.
  We also recorded our weekly video today, and everything went smoothly—no issues at all, just a seamless process. It felt great to see our teamwork and preparation pay off.
