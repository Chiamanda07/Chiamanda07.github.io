what_i_learned: |
  Today, we continued working on our literature reviews. A PhD student visited our session and gave us valuable advice on how to write a strong research paper. She emphasized the importance of identifying the gaps, limitations, or overlooked areas in previous studies so we can address those issues in our own work. She also highlighted the need to carefully document the methodologies used in past experiments and compare them to our own.
  In addition, we discussed how we plan to collect our data and the sources we will use. We agreed to explore all counties in Maryland to see if similar ideas have been proposed or implemented before. This will help us understand the current landscape and determine how our research can make a unique contribution. 
  Three videos related to the project were watched to gain a better understanding of what the final outcome could look like, even though the project itself is not exactly the same.
  
blockers: |
  I didn't necessarily have a blocker except from a mild headache for most of the day.

reflection: |
  We didn’t begin collecting our data today, but we were able to outline our next steps. I completed the article on ultrasonic sensors and started reading one on IoT-Based Route Recommendation. Each article provides foundational knowledge for different parts of our project. They help clarify both the objective and the steps needed to achieve it. With each reading, the overall process becomes easier to understand. The videos watched help give me a good visual image of what we are doing.
