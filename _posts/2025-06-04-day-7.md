what_i_learned: |
  Today, we continued working on our literature reviews. A PhD student visited our session and gave us valuable advice on how to write a strong research paper. She emphasized the importance of identifying the gaps, limitations, or overlooked areas in previous studies so we can address those issues in our own work. She also highlighted the need to carefully document the methodologies used in past experiments and compare them to our own.
  In addition, we discussed how we plan to collect our data and the sources we will use. We agreed to explore all counties in Maryland to see if similar ideas have been proposed or implemented before. This will help us understand the current landscape and determine how our research can make a unique contribution.
  
blockers: |
  I didn't necessarily have a blocker except from a mild headache for most of the day.

reflection: |
  We didn't start getting our data today, but we were able to make an outline of what we are to do.
