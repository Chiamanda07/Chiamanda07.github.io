  Today, we finally got the GPS sensor working! One of the main issues was with the wiring — I kept connecting the TX pin on the GPS sensor to the TX on the ESP32, when it should have been connected to the RX pin instead.

  Aside from that, we were also able to attach the RFID reader. At first, I was confused about its purpose. It didn’t seem practical for people to need an RFID card just to use a trash bin. After discussing it as a team, one of my group members suggested using a camera module instead. That idea made a lot more sense, and our faculty member agreed with it.

  We also wrote sample code for each sensor and planned how we would connect them to Firebase for real-time data updates.



blockers: |
  We couldn't go about adding our solar panel because we didn't have a 3.7v battery.
  We aren't too sure on what WIFI we can use for the firebase code, because the Morgan one wasn't really working.
  
reflection: |
  In addition to the tasks I worked on today, I also took time to read up on how to properly connect the solar panel. I found out that we can’t use the jumper cables exactly as they came — we might need to remove some extra components from them first. Although we didn’t get to connect the panel today, I now clearly understand how to do it once the battery arrives, so we won’t lose any time when that moment comes.
