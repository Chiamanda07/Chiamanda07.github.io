what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a SAIRI Cohort Connect session, which was a great experience. We took various personality tests to better understand our individual working styles and how we can enhance our team performance.

  According to the VARK test, I am multimodal (VAK), which means I learn best through visual, aural, and kinesthetic methods. My Myers-Briggs personality type is ISTJ (The Inspector). This aligns with how I see myself—I’m organized, detail-oriented, and prefer structure over sudden change.

  After the break, I shifted my focus to our smart waste bin device. We had developed a new version of the code, and today I was able to test it. This version was significantly better than the original, as it updated the data column every 10 seconds, improving the system’s responsiveness. Although I ran into some issues with the Firebase connection initially, I was able to troubleshoot and resolve the problem successfully.

  NO blockers today.
  
reflection: |
  During the break today, I had the chance to hang out with people from other groups. We shared updates on our progress, and I learned a lot from their experiences. They explained the methods they use to track their progress, the challenges they are currently facing, and their plans to overcome them.
  Meanwhile, my teammates continued working on our machine learning model and made significant progress. Originally, we planned to use a regression model, but due to a very high RMSE, they decided to switch to a classification model instead.
