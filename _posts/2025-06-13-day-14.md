what_i_learned: |
  Today, we explored machine learning and trained a model using the Random Forest algorithm. We implemented everything using Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab. Although we had a sample code to guide us, we went through each step ourselves — from simulating fake data, to splitting the data into training and testing sets, to making predictions and checking the accuracy and validity of our model.
  I also learned what Scikit-learn is and how to use it to import the functions needed to train the model.
  After completing the machine learning part, we finished working on our slideshow and recorded the presentation video.

  It was a bit confusing at first, because of all the new terminologies that were introduced.

reflection: |
  When training the machine learning model, we use features and labels. In our project, the label is the fill level of the waste bin — that's what we want the model to predict. We haven’t yet defined the features, but they would be the different factors that affect how full the bin gets.
  Today, while doing some machine learning, I realized that I actually enjoy coding and AI a lot. It made me start thinking about possibly doing a minor in computer science.
