what_i_learned: |
  Today, we learned how to create and deliver a pitch. Each group was assigned a different topic to pitch on, and my group was tasked with researching a useless gadget and presenting it as if it were useful. This activity was very educational—I learned what elements make up an effective pitch, how to develop market strategies, and more. After preparing, we presented our pitch and received constructive criticism from others. Their feedback helped us identify our mistakes and understand how to improve.

reflection: |
  Today’s lesson on how to make a pitch was both challenging and enlightening. Being asked to turn a seemingly useless gadget into something marketable pushed us to think creatively and strategically. It wasn’t just about coming up with ideas—it was about learning how to communicate them in a convincing way. I especially appreciated learning the key elements of a successful pitch, such as identifying a target audience, crafting a value proposition, and developing a marketing strategy.
