what_i_learned: |
  Today was very productive. We successfully set up our dashboard using React and Vite. We also began integrating Firebase storage into the project. Later, Mr. Joseph joined us to help fix issues in our machine learning code. Over the weekend, we had attempted to create a new label for our dataset, but encountered many null values. Mr. Joseph guided us on how to handle those null values and provided us with a suitable database for training our model.

blockers: |
  Our initial attempt at creating a React project didn’t work. We later realized that the traditional React setup we tried to use was outdated. To resolve this, we switched to using React with Vite, which provides a faster and more modern development environment.

  I also worked on charging our battery using the solar panel. While doing that, I met an electrical engineering professor, Mr. Hudson. He explained how I could calibrate the solar panel to ensure it functions properly. Additionally, we created a new label that helps us predict how many hours it takes for a trash can to become full.
