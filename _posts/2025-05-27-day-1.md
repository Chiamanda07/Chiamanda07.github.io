what_i_learned: |
  I learned what Git and GitHub are. I learned that Git was a version control flow system, and GitHub was an online platform used to access Git. I also learned about some Git commands such as clone, pull, push, add, and commit. I learned what conflicts are (when 2 or more people push something to the same lines) and how to avoid them.   
  Except for that, at the beginning of the day, we had a placement test for Python, which I think I did pretty decent on. There was also a speed bingo game to get to know other people. It was pretty fun.

blockers: |
  Completing the whole bingo card was hard, cause there was no one who was afraid of heights.

reflection: |
  I've always been confused about what GitHub was for; however, it was clarified to me during the meeting.
