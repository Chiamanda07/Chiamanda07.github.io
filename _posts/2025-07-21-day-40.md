what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a workshop on Overleaf. We learned how to change the title, add various sections, include references, and collaborate without interfering with each other’s work. After the break, the components for assembling our prototype arrived, so we began organizing them. We marked the areas that needed to be cut and were also able to complete the assembly drawing.
blockers: |
  The IDE code could not be executed on ESP32 without having a physical connection with the computer
  
reflection: |
  I initially thought my solar panel connection wasn’t working. However, the problem was actually with the LEDs I was using to test it. Dr. Blessing came in today and showed me a more effective way to check the panel. He also taught me how to connect it to the ESP32 to power the board.
