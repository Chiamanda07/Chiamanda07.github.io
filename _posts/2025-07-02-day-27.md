what_i_learned: |
  Today, our main focus was on finalizing our presentation materials. I specifically worked on creating the slide that covers our data and preliminary analysis, making sure it clearly explains the key insights we gathered. In addition, I completed the editing of our demo video, ensuring it flows smoothly and effectively showcases the functionality of our project.

As a team, we practiced delivering our full presentation. After the first run-through, we identified areas that needed improvement—such as pacing, transitions between speakers, and clarity of explanations. We made the necessary adjustments, then rehearsed it again to build confidence and ensure everything was well-coordinated for our final delivery.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive and insightful day as we focused on preparing for our upcoming presentation. I took the lead on designing the slide that covered our data and preliminary analysis. This step really helped me reflect on the importance of clearly communicating our findings in a way that's both informative and easy to follow.
  Overall, today reminded me how valuable preparation and teamwork are. It’s one thing to build a project, but it’s another to be able to communicate it clearly and confidently. I’m proud of how far we’ve come and excited to share our work!
