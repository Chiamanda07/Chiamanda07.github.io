what_i_learned: |
  Today, my group participated in the SOE Summer Research Symposium, where we presented the progress we've made on our research so far. It was a very enlightening experience—I got to learn about several other fascinating research projects. Afterwards, I attached the battery and fully assembled the IoT device. I then began working on my presentation slides.

  Today was full of little wins that meant a lot. Presenting at the SOE Summer Research Symposium pushed me out of my comfort zone, but it also reminded me why I love being part of a research community. Seeing the creativity behind other students’ projects was incredibly inspiring—it made me excited about what's possible when curiosity meets hard work.
  After the event, I finally connected the battery and fully assembled our IoT device. It might seem like a small step, but holding the completed prototype in my hands felt like a milestone. I also started putting together my slides for the final presentation. Bit by bit, it’s all coming together—and I’m learning that progress doesn’t always look flashy, but it always counts..
