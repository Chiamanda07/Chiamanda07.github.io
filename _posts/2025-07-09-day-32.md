  Today, I began by finalizing the data preparation process for our dataset. I removed redundant and clearly incorrect rows to ensure data quality. I also converted the time column from string format to datetime, and extracted several new time-based features: hour, month, weekday, weekend indicator, and season.

  After cleaning the data, I trained two machine learning models — Random Forest and Logistic Regression. To prepare the features for modeling, I applied label encoding to categorical variables and used a Standard Scaler to normalize both the training and testing datasets.

  In the afternoon, we shifted focus to our research paper. Ms. Grace gave us an overview of what the research should include and broke down the structure. She then assigned each of us a section to write. I was tasked with the Methodology section, and I began working on it.

reflection: |
  Today's work helped me appreciate the importance of both technical and collaborative aspects of research. Cleaning the dataset and engineering new time-related features taught me how even small preprocessing steps—like converting time formats—can significantly impact the quality and usability of a dataset. I also saw firsthand how crucial it is to handle categorical variables correctly and normalize data before feeding it into models. Comparing the performance of Random Forest and Logistic Regression gave me a deeper understanding of how different algorithms interpret data.
  In the afternoon, transitioning from technical tasks to academic writing was a refreshing challenge. Ms. Grace’s breakdown of the research process made it clearer how each section of a paper fits together. Being assigned the Methodology section made me reflect more deeply on the steps we took so far and how to communicate them effectively. Writing about what we’ve done in a structured and clear way is helping me think more critically about our approach and the reasoning behind our choices.
  Overall, today was a balanced mix of hands-on learning and academic development. It reminded me how research is not just about doing the work—but also about explaining it well.
