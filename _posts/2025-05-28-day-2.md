what_i_learned: |
  Today began with a meeting with our faculty advisor and graduate mentor. I had the opportunity to speak with them one-on-one and clear up some misunderstandings I had about the prerequisites I needed to complete before the program officially starts. It was helpful to get clarity and feel more confident moving forward. 
  Later in the day, I attended Python 102. Although I was already familiar with dictionaries and sets, the session served as a great refresher. I also picked up a few new methods and functions that I hadn’t used before, which I’m excited to try out in future coding exercises.
