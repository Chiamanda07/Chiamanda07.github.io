what_i_learned: |
  I had the opportunity to learn from Ms. Water and Dr. Kofi Nyaku, whose insights truly stimulated my thinking, especially around the topic of ethics in AI. Their discussions opened my eyes to the moral and societal responsibilities tied to developing and using artificial intelligence.

  During our lab session, I also learned valuable research skills, such as how to properly cite research papers and how to locate credible scholarly articles online.To wrap up the day, we organized and delegated tasks for the week ahead. I’m really excited about the work we’re going to do and the knowledge we’ll continue to build as a team.

  There were no blockers today

reflection: |
  Today was really great, as I finally got to match the voices and faces I’d been seeing on Zoom to real people. It felt refreshing to interact with my peers in person, and it helped build a stronger sense of connection and collaboration. I also learned a good amount about research today. One highlight was being assigned the role of group manager—a responsibility I'm excited to take on. I found my first article to begin working on a literature review, which marks the beginning of a deeper dive into our research topic.
