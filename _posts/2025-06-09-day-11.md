what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a masterclass on Arduino. We started by watching YouTube videos that explained what Arduino is, its components, and how to write basic code for it. I learned that we’re using Arduino for our project because it’s one of the most versatile tools for combining electronics with coding. It also supports a wide range of libraries created by people around the world—for components like LEDs, servo motors, and more.
  Since our physical components haven’t arrived yet, most of the masterclass focused on writing code. We worked on a program to turn an LED on and off, and another one that used a potentiometer to control the rotation of a servo motor. Even though we didn’t have the hardware, it was great to learn the coding side of things in preparation for when the components arrive.

  It was a bit difficult to concentrate while watching the videos, mainly because we didn’t have the physical components to follow along and actually see the code in action.

reflection: |
   I’ve seen people use Arduino before, but this was my first time actually coding with its IDE. Initially, I thought it would require learning an entirely new programming language. However, I found out that although Arduino has some built-in functions specific to its platform, it primarily uses C and C++. I thought this was really nice because, even though I don’t have the strongest background in C++, I’ve tried it before. Looking at the Arduino code brought back some of the things I had previously learned and helped me reconnect with those concepts.
