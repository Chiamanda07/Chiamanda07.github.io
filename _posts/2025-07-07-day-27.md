what_i_learned: |
  Today, I started my day by going through the machine learning code our faculty mentor gave us last Wednesday, line by line. He mentioned that we’ll each be presenting it to him individually on Friday, so it’s important that we fully understand every part of it. As I studied the code, I came across a lot of new syntax. Some of the things I learned include how to use random.random() and how to apply standard scaling to the training set using StandardScaler.

  After the break, Mr. Joseph joined us with a fictitious dataset he created. Together, we walked through the entire machine learning process using his dataset. We trained three models for regression and two models for classification. He also explained various model evaluation metrics, including the F1 score and other accuracy methods. One key insight I gained today was that Mean Absolute Error (MAE) has an inverse relationship with the R² score — as MAE decreases, R² typically increases.

  Didn't have blockers.
  
reflection: |
  At the beginning of the day, we spent some time reflecting on our next steps and setting goals for the week. One of our main objectives is to begin collecting data from the trash bins, and we also want to deepen our understanding of the machine learning process. I learned today that if the data collection stage is flawed, it can negatively affect the accuracy of the entire model. That’s why it’s important for us to set clear restrictions and rules on how data is added to our tables to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset.
