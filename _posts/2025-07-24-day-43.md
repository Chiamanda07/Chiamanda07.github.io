what_i_learned: |
  I started my day by writing the “model to Firebase” section of my methodology. Since I didn’t work on that part of the code myself, I had to go through the Google Colab notebook to fully understand it first. After that, I reviewed the entire machine learning section and corrected grammar and other issues.

  After break, I continued working on calibrating the gas sensor—but I haven’t had any success with it yet.

  Caliberating our gas sensor
  
reflection: |
  Calibrating the gas sensor has been really difficult for me. Converting the voltage readings to PPM (parts per million) isn’t straightforward—there’s no simple formula unless prior research has been done to identify specific calibration points. Unfortunately, we don’t have access to hazardous gases to conduct that kind of testing ourselves, which makes it even harder. Honestly, it’s not just hard—it’s frustrating.
