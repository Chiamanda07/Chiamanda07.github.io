what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a tour of the entire Morgan State University campus. It was both fun and educational. I had the opportunity to talk with students from other projects and learn more about what they’re working on, including the goals of their projects and the techniques they plan to use.

  The tour also helped me discover campus resources that could support our project—for example, the Writing Center, which will be helpful when preparing my final report.

  After the tour, our group met to divide up responsibilities for our slideshow. We created an outline and then completed the full presentation. Later, I continued working on my literature review, focusing this time on the role of AI in smart waste bin systems.

  I wasn't able to finish the article on AI's role in Smart waste bins, but I plan on finishing it tomorrow. 

reflection: |
  We had another meeting with our graduate mentor to discuss updates regarding the project. He informed us of some changes, including the decision not to use YOLO, as it wouldn’t be very cost-effective for our application. However, I still have a strong interest in learning about YOLO and hope to explore and practice using it independently.Additionally, visiting Morgan State University was a great experience. The campus looked well-organized and conducive to learning. I was especially impressed by the number of buildings dedicated to different fields of study—it shows that the university values and invests in a wide range of academic disciplines, which I believe is essential for a strong educational environment.
