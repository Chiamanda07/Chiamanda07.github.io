  Today, we had a research workshop, and it was amazing. I learned so much from Dr. Anita Pandey, especially about how to properly write a research paper—what to do and what to avoid. Some key takeaways were: avoid using active voice; instead, write in passive tense. Also, always credit the original sources of your findings, even during presentations. If your solution isn’t definite, be very careful with your wording to avoid sounding overly certain.

  During the workshop, I also practiced writing my research paper title and introduction, making sure to include both background information and a clear problem statement. After that, I worked on visualizing our dataset, and then we planned the new labels we needed to develop.

  Our visualization looked off, and the data wasn't being represented the way we expected.
  
reflection: |
  After the break, a lot happened. Our mentor nearly scrapped part of the project because it didn’t look like we’d be able to finish on time. However, my team and I were determined to do well and complete what we started. So, we created an amazing outline and a solid plan to finish the sections that were almost removed by Monday next week.
  I also had the chance to speak with Dr. Anita after her presentation on public speaking. I thought she was a phenomenal speaker. Her lawyer friend shared a helpful tip with me—that the key to great public speaking is treating the audience like a friend and believing they genuinely want to hear what you have to say.
