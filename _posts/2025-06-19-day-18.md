what_i_learned: |
  After several attempts, we finally got our ESP32 microcontroller to connect with our laptops. The issue turned out to be the drivers—we had been installing the wrong ones all along. Once we corrected that, everything started working smoothly.

With that major problem out of the way, we moved on to assembling other components. We learned how to use the breadboard and began connecting various wires to it, getting hands-on experience with physical circuitry and layout. It was a productive and encouraging day!

  The jumper wires we had didn’t have male-to-male connectors, which we needed to make proper connections on the breadboard.

  We we finally solved the persistent issue with our ESP32 microcontroller. With that behind us, we were able to shift our focus to hands-on work. We explored how to use a breadboard and began connecting components with jumper wires. It was exciting to see the physical side of our project come to life, and it really helped solidify our understanding of circuit layouts.
In addition to the technical progress, we also wrapped up our weekly slideshow. We finalized the slides and recorded ourselves presenting it. This was a great opportunity to practice our communication skills and reflect on everything we’ve learned so far. Watching our recording made it clear how much we’ve grown in both our technical abilities and confidence..
