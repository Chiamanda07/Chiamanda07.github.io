  We had a meeting in the morning to discuss how we’ll move forward in order to finish this research project on time. One of the main concerns we addressed was the delay in getting data from our device for machine learning. Since that process might take too long, we decided to find a dataset online instead.

  However, finding the right dataset was more difficult than expected. Most publicly available datasets focus on image classification of waste, not fill level data. I did find one that included fill levels, but its features didn’t align with the type of data we plan to collect ourselves.

  Thankfully, one of my teammates found a dataset that was a better fit. Once we had the data, we spent the rest of the day cleaning it. The dataset was really messy, so even by the end of the day, we still weren’t done.

  During our meeting, we realized that we need to readjust several aspects of our workflow and rethink our overall approach. Our mentors helped us by providing a structured daily work template, which will help guide how we manage our tasks. We also created a weekly timeline to stay on track and ensure we meet our deadlines.
  One big realization was that cleaning the data took much more time than I expected. Even though it was time-consuming, it was rewarding to go through the process ourselves from scratch. It helped me better understand how important and foundational this step is for the entire project.
