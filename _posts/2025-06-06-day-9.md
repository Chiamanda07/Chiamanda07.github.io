what_i_learned: |
  Today,I finished reading my last literature review for the week, which focused on AI for fill-level prediction and smart city waste logistics. It was an insightful read, especially because the study centered around hospital waste bins. I learned how the researchers collected and prepared their data, then used linear regression as their algorithm to train the model. They later tested it and reached a strong conclusion.

  One key takeaway was understanding the importance of splitting data into training and test sets—not all your data should be used to train a model. This helps improve the model's accuracy when it faces new data.
  Later in the day, we also discussed the specific materials we’ll be using for our project, which helped clarify the direction we’re heading. 
  
  After that, we all added some final touches to our weekly slideshow (to add plus the things we did today), then we recorded our video presentation using Zoom. We initially thought we’d get it right on the first try, but our video went over the 4–7 minute limit. So, we had to cut out a few parts and condense the content to stay within the time range.

reflection: |
   Doing the slideshow was interesting because I got to learn how to use new tools, like Zoom, to present in front of a group. Normally, I would just use Canvas, so this was a new experience for me. The literature review activity was also a great way to start our first in-person week. It gave me the chance to explore how others have done similar projects and helped me understand the process we’ll be following. By the end of the day, our graduate mentor mentioned that he would give us a list over the weekend showing how the materials we’ll be using are connected
