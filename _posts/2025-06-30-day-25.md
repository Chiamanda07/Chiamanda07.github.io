what_i_learned: |
  Today, we divided the presentation slides among group members for the mid-summer symposium. I worked on one of the literature review slides, the data slide, and the accomplishments slide.

  After that, we began working on our demo video. Since our GPS module doesn’t work indoors, we had to go outside to test it. We started running our code and recording the process.

  Although we didn’t finish filming, once we got back inside, I began editing the video.

  Later, a GitHub repository was created to organize and store all our project code.

  While doing our demo video outside, it started rtaining.
  
reflection: |
  While working on the demo video, I realized we need to start thinking about how to properly cover or case our Arduino system, as any liquid or waste thrown into the trash bin could easily damage the electronics. This highlighted the importance of considering real-world environmental factors when designing practical hardware—not just focusing on code and data. I also noticed that we need to move a bit faster with our work, especially because collecting meaningful data isn’t something that happens in a day. It may take a week or more, so starting early and staying consistent is key.
