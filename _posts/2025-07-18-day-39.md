what_i_learned: |
  Today, I redid the AutoCAD drawing because of the mistake I made yesterday. I also tried learning how to change it into a 3D model. I wasn't able to but I tried by watching different youtube videos. My teammates who worked on the route optimization part explained the code to me. We also made our weekly video

reflection: |
  It was interesting seeing what y other teammates have been working on. Understanding what they did for route optimization was a bit challenging just ooking at it. However, he really explained it well. So there was no problem . We also started brainstorming for our 90 seconds elevator pitch. Everyone had amazing ideas. But, we were not able to come to conclusion on any idea yet.
