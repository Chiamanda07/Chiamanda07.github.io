what_i_learned: |
  The first half of today was spent trying to get our GPS sensor to work. We initially realized that it wasn’t fully connected to the breadboard because the indicator light, which should have been on, wasn’t lighting up. We tried adjusting it at different angles, but eventually discovered that one of the components of the GPS sensor was faulty. So, we had to find an alternative for that part.

  After that, we managed to get the LED to work, but our code still wasn’t functioning properly.

  After the break, Mr. Joseph returned and gave us a workshop on deep learning. We learned about neural networks, backpropagation, loss functions, and gradient descent.

  The GPS test code runs, but it's not producing any output.
  
reflection: |
  During the Machine Learning workshop, one thing that really stood out to me was realizing that a model with 100% accuracy might not actually be good at predicting values. Sometimes, it could just be randomly guessing and coincidentally getting the right answers, which doesn't necessarily mean it's reliable.
  Another important lesson I learned is that not all problems have straightforward solutions. You might spend a lot of time researching and still not find the answer right away—but that’s okay. What matters is persistence. For example, with the GPS sensor, I watched YouTube tutorials, tried debugging, and followed different methods, but it still isn’t working yet. Even though I don’t fully understand why it’s not functioning, I’m determined not to give up. I’m looking forward to trying again tomorrow.
