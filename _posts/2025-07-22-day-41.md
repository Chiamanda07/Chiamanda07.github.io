what_i_learned: |
  I was ablle to get the IDE code to work on the  ESP32 without having a physical connection with the computer. It turns out it was due to the way we connected the battery to the ESP32. Once we got it working. It did well. We were also ablr to cut out holes in our container for our sensors to get readings from.
  After break we shot our elevator pitch video.

  Memorizing lines
  
reflection: |
  Getting creative and bringing up ideas for the elevator pitch wasn;t the easiest for me. I'm very thankful to my teammates as they have such creative minds. It also turns out I'm not as good as memorizing as I thought. My clips took the longest to film casue I kept messing up my lines. But at the end we were able to finish the whole thing and think its gonna come out great.
