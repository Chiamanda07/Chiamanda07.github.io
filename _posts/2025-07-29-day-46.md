what_i_learned: |
  Today was a focused and productive day as I worked on refining various aspects of my smart waste management research project. I began by polishing the wording in my abstract and fixing tense inconsistencies to improve clarity, then moved on to formatting issues in Overleaf, such as centering images and organizing bullet points

blockers: |
  No blockers.
  
reflection: |
  I worked on our presentation slideshow and completed all of my assigned sections. I also helped my teammates with their parts to make sure everything was consistent and clear. In addition, I created a rough sketch of what our demo video will look like. Overall, it felt good to contribute both individually and as a team.
