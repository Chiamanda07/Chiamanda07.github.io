what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned a lot about Computer Vision. I explored what it is and some of its core tasks: object detection, image classification, object tracking, and image segmentation. After that, I learned how to use YOLO—a computer vision model—in combination with Python. I also got to use Google's Teachable Machine to train a computer to identify a pen, my glasses, and a pair of scissors.
  The next part of the day was the Python 102 class. We reviewed yesterday’s problems involving dictionaries and sets, and then moved on to working with files. I really enjoyed this class because I got to practice many Python skills I’ve learned. I haven’t coded in a while, so it was a great refresher. I had never really worked with files before, but today I learned how to read from and write to files in Python.

  I had some trouble with the set problem, but after seeing others' solutions, I understood it better.

reflection: |
  Just like yesterday, I was reminded that there's always more to learn than you think. I also developed a new, genuine interest in computer vision. Although I had read about it before, actually working on it made it much more fun and easier to understand. This hands-on activity really got me excited to begin working on my project, especially since it involves using YOLO.
