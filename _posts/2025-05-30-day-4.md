what_i_learned: |
  We started the day with Python 102, focusing on a revision of reading files. After the revision, we received project assignments. I did struggle at first with some of the initial tasks, but as I worked through them, I was able to develop solutions, which challenged my brain and helped me think critically. 
  Later, we attended a workshop on Generative AI and LLMs led by Clyde. I learned the differences between AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative Learning, as well as how each is used and evolved. Additionally, I learned new terms like tokenization—breaking input into chunks—and embedding—transforming these tokenized pieces into numerical representations. The session concluded with an “AI or Not AI” game, leading to a discussion about AI watermarkers, which I learned are invisible markers on AI-generated images or videos that can be detected with the right tools

  I encountered some issues while writing my Lab 2 code, but during the presentation, my fellow undergraduate researchers helped me correct them.

reflection: |
  AI has come a long way—it’s not a new concept, having originated in 1956—but its growth in recent years has been exponential. It’s exciting and important to understand what AI is, how to use it effectively, and how to recognize or detect its presence in today's world,
