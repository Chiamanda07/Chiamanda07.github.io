what_i_learned: |
  Today, I started by learning how to train a linear regression model. We were given a PowerPoint presentation on the topic, and I also watched a YouTube video to better understand the basics. The video included a sample exercise, which I followed and completed.

  After finishing the coding exercise, my group and I began working with the physical components. However, there was a delay because we didn’t have a micro USB cable to connect the ESP32 board to our computers. While our graduate mentor went to find one, I used the time to watch videos on how to use a breadboard, since it's essential for connecting the jumper wires.

  Once our mentor returned with the cable, we installed the necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE. For the rest of the day, we focused on trying to connect the Arduino port to our code.
  
blockers: |
  1. I had difficulty finding the appropriate built-in functions for feature engineering while working on the sample coding exercise.
  2. We experienced a setback trying to find the correct cable to connect the ESP32 board to our laptops.
  3. I wasn’t able to upload the code to the microcontroller because the port didn’t appear in either my Device Manager or the Arduino IDE.

  Today was the most challenging day I’ve had so far during this program. Despite the difficulties, it felt really rewarding when we were able to solve most of the problems we faced. One major issue was the port connection problem—I suspect it might be something specific to my laptop, so I plan to look into it more when I get home.
  Over the weekend, I had been reading about machine learning, but actually practicing how to train a model made me realize that reading alone isn’t enough. I struggled to apply what I had read because each machine learning problem is unique. To truly understand how to use built-in functions and apply concepts effectively, consistent hands-on practice is essential.
