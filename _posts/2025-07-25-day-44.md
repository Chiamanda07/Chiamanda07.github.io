  Today was really fun!
  I started the day by attending a workshop led by Dr. Chris S. Crawford, who taught on Human-Computer Interface. He discussed some of his ongoing research using brain waves (EEG) to control objects like drones, and also talked about using EMG signals to control robots. After the session, we even got to interact with these devices ourselves — it was so cool!
  After the break, I finished reading through a section of my methodology and then began doing more research on the gas sensor. I found a promising GitHub repository, but I still couldn’t get it to work. However, I did gain a much better understanding of how it functions.

reflection: |
  Attending the workshop was really meaningful to me because it aligned closely with what I want to do in the future. After the session, I had the opportunity to speak with the instructor and network with him. I also asked him questions about robotics and sought his advice on the best path to take as an undergraduate student pursuing this field.
