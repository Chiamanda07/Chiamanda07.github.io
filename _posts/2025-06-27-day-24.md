what_i_learned: |
  Today, we mainly focused on getting Firebase to work. We started by testing it with just one component—the RFID reader—to make sure the connection would work. At first, our serial monitor was only displaying dots, which we later realized meant that the ESP32 wasn’t connected to Wi-Fi.

  We had used my phone as the Wi-Fi source, but it turns out that phones typically operate on a 5GHz band, while the ESP32 only supports 2.4GHz. To fix this, we enabled the "Maximize Compatibility" option on my phone, which allowed it to broadcast at 2.4GHz—and after that, it worked!

  Once that was resolved, we uploaded a code that included all the sensors we had connected, and we were able to see the data successfully sent to Firebase.

  After that, we worked on our slideshow and filmed our weekly video update.

  Taking our video for the week was a bit harder this time, as our High school teacher was also part, so we had to explain everything. Although he didn't get everything at first we were able to sucessfully finish it at the end.

reflection: |
  Today, I was reminded that working in a team isn’t always going to be smooth. Everyone has different opinions, and disagreements are bound to happen. But it's important to remember that we're all working toward the same goal. If you take the time to really listen to others, you might discover a bright idea hidden within the things you initially disagreed with.
  I’m also really excited about how much we accomplished this week. In just a few days, we were able to build the system from scratch and get it nearly finished—only the solar panel and camera module are left. We also successfully set up Firebase, which was a big milestone
