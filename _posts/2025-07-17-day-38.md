  For the first part of the day, we had a research workshop with Ms. Anita. She focused on how to write the background, literature review, and findings sections of a research paper. It was a very informative session. One of the exercises she gave us was to write a summary of a literature review we had previously done. She also shared a helpful formula: Summarize + Shortcomings (Research Gaps) + How it Relates to Your Research.
  After the break, I worked in AutoCAD to create the schematic diagram for the casing of our components, including the top, side, and front views.

  I didn't have any blockers today.
  
reflection: |
  It was so fun using AutoCAD again—it's been a while, and honestly, it's still my favorite software I've ever used. During break, I got the chance to ask Ms. Anita to review my resume, and she gave me some amazing tips for the future, which I really appreciated. While working on my schematic drawing, I made a big mistake with the dimensions. Even though I was able to complete the drawing, the dimensions were incorrect, so I’ll have to start over. Hopefully, I’ll get the chance to redo it this evening if I have time.
