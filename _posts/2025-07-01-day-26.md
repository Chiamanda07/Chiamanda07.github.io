  Today, we spent a good part of the day trying to get the ESP32-CAM module working. Since it's a microcontroller on its own, it was difficult to connect it to the main ESP32 we've been using. We tested the ESP32-CAM by itself and confirmed that it works, but for this project, it needs to be integrated with our original ESP32 board.

After break, we received the batteries needed for the solar component of our Arduino system. We assembled the solar setup, but since the battery needed time to charge, we couldn’t fully test it with the Arduino yet. However, we were able to test it on an LED outdoors, and it worked.

Lastly, before wrapping up for the day, we began designing the visualization of our project using an app built with Claude.

  We needed a plier to cut some of the wires.
  The ESP32 CAM wasn't working when connected to the ESP 32.

  As an incoming electrical engineering sophomore, this whole process has really helped me understand circuits better. I haven’t taken a circuits class yet, but I can already tell that this hands-on experience will give me a strong foundation. Working with the ESP32-CAM also taught me an important lesson: sometimes, you need to pause and step back in order to move forward. I didn’t want to stop troubleshooting until we found the solution, but my teammates convinced me to pause and shift our focus. That decision actually helped us make progress and accomplish more today.
