what_i_learned: |
  Today, we were given research papers to read and summarize during the day. Each paper was related to our overall project, and later, we presented our findings to the group. I was assigned a paper on ultrasonic sounds, where I learned about ultrasonic sensors—what they are, how they will be used in our project, and the reasons behind choosing them. This literature review helped me gain a deeper understanding of our project.
  The paper I reviewed was titled Smart Waste Bin System.
  Later in the day, we brainstormed a name and designed a logo for our project as if we were turning it into a real product. We decided to name it C.L.E.A.R., which stands for Cloud-Enabled Automation for Refuse. We concluded the day by presenting a pitch for our product.

  I didn't have any blockers

reflection: |
  There's no "I" in team. When it came time to create the logo and product name, everyone contributed amazing ideas. It was clear to me that I couldn’t have come up with what we did on my own. The collaboration and creativity from each person really brought the concept of C.L.E.A.R. to life.
