what_i_learned: |
  Today, we were given papers to read during the day and summarize. Then we presented it. Each person's oaoer had something to do with our research. I was told to read in ultrasonic sounds. I learned what ultrasonic sensors were, how they are going to be used in our project, and why we are using those sensors in the project. This research review really made me understand the project much more.
  Then we made a logo and a name for our project if we were to make it a product. The name of the product was C.L.E.A.R. - for  Cloud Enabled Automation for Refuse.
