what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on advancing the smart trash bin system using the ESP32 by integrating RFID, GPS, ultrasonic, and gas sensors for real-time data collection. I focused on refining the sendAlert() function to send accurate alerts to  Firebase, including bin status, timestamps, and priority levels. While testing, I encountered Firebase authentication errors like ADMIN_ONLY_OPERATION and EMAIL_EXISTS, which I began troubleshooting. I also monitored token status logs and confirmed successful RFID detection through serial output. These updates improved the system’s ability to send structured alerts and highlighted areas needing further debugging.

  Trying to get the RFID to show on the firebase.
  
reflection: |
  We spoke with our mentors about the hardware casing for our project. The discussion was really insightful, as it exposed me to the design side of engineering, which I hadn't explored much before. I created a rough sketch of the casing and collaborated with my mentors to search for useful components and materials online. In addition to that, I supported another team by helping them with the machine learning aspect of their project.
