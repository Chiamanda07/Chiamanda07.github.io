what_i_learned: |
  We started the day at Cohort Connect, where Dr. Mack addressed several important topics and updates. After that, we focused on refining our group project pitch, ensuring it could be delivered in under 30 seconds.

  Later, we had the opportunity to meet the high school teacher who will be joining our project. We sat down with him to introduce ourselves, brief him on our project goals, and explain the progress we've made so far.

  After our break, we participated in an icebreaker activity with the other project group and their high school teacher. It was a great way to connect and build community. We then returned to our machine learning work. Since our project uses linear regression, we practiced coding a linear regression model from scratch to strengthen our understanding and skills.

  We got a really huge error in the model we were training.   

reflection: |
  Our high school teacher seems really kind and genuinely interested in our project, which is encouraging. We also had a chance to briefly discuss how we’ll delegate tasks for our upcoming presentation on Friday.
  Working on the machine learning assignment helped me realize that I need more practice, especially with feature engineering. I’ve learned that if certain parts of your data aren’t properly prepared, it can cause major issues when training your model.
