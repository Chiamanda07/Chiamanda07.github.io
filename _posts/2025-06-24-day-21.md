  I did a lot today! I started the day at the business center, where Dr. Naja Mack spoke to us about our presentation on Saturday. She reminded us of what we need to prepare and answered any outstanding questions we had.

  After that, I returned to the lab and worked with my team on attaching the gas sensor. Thanks to the understanding we gained yesterday while working with the ultrasonic sensors, we had no issues. We successfully installed and tested the gas sensor.

  Later on, our faculty mentor introduced us to a PhD student who helped us better understand the basics of machine learning. Although we had read about it before, he explained things in a way that really clarified the concepts. He broke down the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. He also explained that instead of using linear regression, as I initially thought, we would actually be using a deep learning model—specifically for a regression-type problem.

  We also discussed the kinds of features we would need to collect for our model. After that, we began connecting our GPS sensor and setting up our real-time database on Firebase.

  We connected our GPS sensor, but unfortunately, it wasn’t functioning properly
  
reflection: |
  At first, I had some doubts about this project. I wasn’t sure if I would gain everything I hoped to from it. However, this week has been moving much faster than the previous ones, and I’m really starting to enjoy it now. I can already tell that by the end of this program, I’ll have learned so much and grown in ways I didn’t expect.
